        I am currently a Research Fellow at the
        <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/clinical-operational-research-unit/"
          >Clinical Operations Research Unit (CORU)</a
        >
        at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London (UCL)</a>.
        Here I work on problems relating to machine learning applied to
        operational research problems in healthcare. I received my PhD from the
        University of Liverpool in February 2023 under the supervision of
        <a href="https://www.karltuyls.net/">Professor Karl Tuyls</a> and
        <a href="https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~rahul/">Professor Rahul Savani</a>.
