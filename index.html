<p>
Welcome to my homepage! Here you will find information about myself and my research.
</p>

<p>
I am currently a Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/clinical-operational-research-unit/">Clinical Operations Research Unit (CORU)</a> at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London (UCL)</a>.
Here I work on problems relating to machine learning applied to operational research problems in healthcare.
I received my PhD from the University of Liverpool in February 2023 under the supervision of <a href="https://www.karltuyls.net/">Professor Karl Tuyls</a> and <a href="https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~rahul/">Professor Rahul Savani</a>.
